## meteor-dodge
 First game project using scratch. Player controls a rocketship while dodging meteors.
 
 ## What It Does:
 You control a spaceship using the left and right arrow keys and attempt to avoid falling meteors. If a meteor hits your spaceship, the game ends with a sound effect and a message.
 
 ## What I learned
 -Conditionals and loops to control behavior
 -Detecting collision in Scratch
 -Using events like when "when green flag clicked"
 -Basic game design structure
 
 ## How to Play
 -Press the Green Flag
 -Use left arrow key to move left, right arrow key to move right
 -Don't get hit by the meteor

 # Week 1: Hello, World & Mario C Assignments
This is my first C program I wrote for cs50. The goal of this assignment was to get familiar with writing, compiling, and running a program in C.

# What it does: This program prints the message: hello, world

## What I learned
- How to write a basic C program
- How to use #include <stdio.h> for input/output
- How to compile code using 'make'
- How to execute a compiled C program

## How to Run It:
1. Open terminal
2. Go to hello.c folder
3. Compile code by typing "make hello"
4. Run the program using ./hello

## File:
- 'hello.c' : Source code for Hello World program

## 2. Mario (Less)

## What It Does:
This program asks the user to input a height (1-8) and prints a right aligned pyramid just like one on a mario game.

## What I Learned:
- How to prompt a user for input using 'get_int()'
- How to use 'do...while' loops
= How to use 'for loops' nested in each other 

## How to Run:
1. Open Terminal
2. Go to 'mario-less' folder
3. Compile the code by typing 'make mario'
4. Run the program with './mario'
5. Enter a height between 1 and 8

## File:
- 'mario.c' - Source code for Marioless program
